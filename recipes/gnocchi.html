    <h1>Gnocchi (or Ã‘oquis)!</h1>
    <p>A fine Italian pasta dish! Another one of my favorites that my mom would routinely make every 29th of each month- as is custom in Argentina.
        This food is usually made with bolognese tomato sauce. A small plate of gnocchi would leave you extrememly full. A full stomach
        is a happy stomach! Check out the ingredients and the recipe down below! Try it out!</p>
