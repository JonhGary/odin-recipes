    <h1>Sauced Baked Chicken!</h1>
        <p>A delicious and easy meal cooked with a delicious sauce to go along with the chicken. This meal 
            is meant to be eaten before the "siesta". It's supposed to help you sleep and feel well rested after this meal.
            Another one of my favorites, I'm excited to share it with everybody so <strong>here it goes!!</strong></p>

                    <li>Then we must season the chicken with all of the seasoning listed in the ingredients list.</li>
                    <li>when the vegetables are golden, we add the chicken and let it cook for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>After both sides are semi cooked, we add some white wine and turn the heat on high </li>
                    <li>We let the alcohol evaporate for a few minutes then add water enough to cover the chicken.</li>
                    <li>Once the water starts boiling, we let it cook for a few more minutes and turn the heat back to medium.</li>
                    <li>We then remove the pan from the stove and add the whipping cream and stur until the liquid becomes creamy</li>
